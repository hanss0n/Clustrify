Clustrify allows Spotify users to group their playlists into clusters depending on the euclidian distance of the attributes of the songs. 
Thus, songs with similar attributes will be grouped together. This is especially useful if you're only interested in a specific type of music and don't want to listen through hours of playlists just to find the songs that suit your taste.
